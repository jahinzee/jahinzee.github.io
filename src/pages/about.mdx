# Hi, I'm Jahin[^1]…

…but I often go by my username `jahinzee` on the Internet.

## Re: Code

My primary working language is **Python**, it's the one I adore most and get most things done in.

However I'm not shy with using other languages. I also work a lot with Go and Typescript, and I have
some experience with Rust, Java, C and Scala. I also enjoy tinkering with random other languages,
including [esoteric languages (esolangs)][esolangs].

My philosophy on code structure is very vibe-oriented, as I think it should be. This is not to be
confused with [vibe coding][], which I think is plain silly.

I'm also a major proponent for Free and Open-Source Software, and also [Local-First][] software.

## Re: Graphics

I've been doing graphic design for a very long time – longer than even programming – ever since I
picked up Microsoft PowerPoint when I was in school. I've made a tremendous amount of stuff in that
app, however a lot of those files are sadly lost to a hard drive crash :(

These days, I still do graphic design stuff, primarily as a hobby, using tools like [Lunacy][],
[Inkscape][] and [GIMP][] + [PhotoGIMP][].


I'm a big fan of humanist sans-serif fonts, namely [Frutiger][] and [Noto Sans][], but I do enjoy
some grotesque fonts like [Libre Franklin][]. In case you're wondering, I use [Iosevka Extended][]
for my terminals and code editors. 

**P.S.** The [Android Holo/Dark Skeuomorphism][][^2] aesthetic was the best aesthetic to ever exist,
         and I _will_ fight you on this.
