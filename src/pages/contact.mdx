# Contact

## Email

The best way to get in touch with me is by this email address[^1]:

<div class="alig">
    <object
        data="/email.svg"
        type="image/svg+xml"
        style="
            display: block;
            height: 2.25rem;
            margin: auto;"
    >
    </object>
</div>

I usually keep my inbox in check between `10:00` to `20:00` (Australia/Sydney time).

I'm also on **Bluesky** at [jahinzee.bsky.social][]. I post about various topic on there relatively
often. 

You can also reach out to me via **Signal** at `@jahinzee:matrix.org`.
