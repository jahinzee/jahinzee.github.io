# BANNotation

The **B**anner **A**lgebraic[^1] and **N**ormalised **Notation** (*BANNotation*) is a notation
system that I devised for communicating banner designs in *Minecraft* (Mojang, 2011). This page
will describe this system, and provide some examples of its use.

## Colours

The standard banner colours, and their notated forms, are defined in this collapsed table.

## Syntax

A banner notation starts with a base, and then any number of patterns, in order of their
application.

### Base

> *For a more formal syntax definition, see [Formal Specs](#formal-specs).*

A base banner is simply defined as $B$, where $B$ is the base colour.

### Simple Patterns

A colour-pattern combination is defined as $C$-$P$, where $C$ is a colour, and $P$ is a pattern.
For example, a Blue Chevron would be **Bl-Tb** *(blue triangle bottom)*.

### Combined Gradient Base

For simple gradient bases, instead of notating a base $C_A$ and a gradient bottom $C_B$ (or the
other way with a gradient top), you can use the shorthand **$C_A$+$C_B$-Gx.**, where **Gx** is the
combined gradient pseudo-pattern, $C_A$ is the top colour, and $C_B$ is the bottom colour.

For example, a gradient that goes from blue at the top and red at the bottom would can be either:

- **Rd. Bl-Gt.**, or
- **Bl. Rd-Gb.**

But with the combined gradient syntax, it would be:

- **Bl+Rd-Gx.**

Note that this only works if the gradient is applied immediately after the base. If there are any
patterns that are applied in between, the normal gradient top/bottom should be used instead.

### Formal Specs

A formal specification of the syntax is available in Extended Bachus-Naur (EBNF) form.

<details>
<summary>Syntax in EBNF</summary>

```
colour = "Wh" | "Lg" | "Gr" | "Bk" | "Br" | "Rd" | "Or" | "Ye"
       | "Li" | "Gn" | "Cy" | "Lb" | "Bl" | "Pu" | "Ma" | "Pi"

pattern = "Sb"   | "St"  | "Sl"  | "Sr"  | "Scv" | "Sch" | "Sdw" | "Suw"
        | "Sbar" | "Sx"  | "Scr" | "Wtl" | "Wtr" | "Wbl" | "Wbr" | "Bl"
        | "Br"   | "Bt"  | "Bb"  | "Bbl" | "Bbr" | "Btl" | "Btr" | "Tb"
        | "Tt"   | "Tmb" | "Tmt" | "Cc"  | "Cd"  | "F"   | "Fw"  | "Cb"
        | "Gt"   | "Gb"  | "Cr"  | "Cs"  | "Cf"  | "Cn"  | "Cg"  | "Cp"

solid = colour, "."
gradient = colour, "+", colour, "-Gx."
base = solid | gradient

pattern_set = pattern, { "+", pattern }
layer = colour, "-", pattern_set, "."

banner = base, { " ", layer }
```

## Examples

This example will define all of the banners on the stone brick wall in [this screenshot][jeb-banners],
posted by Jeb on Twitter/X. Only the first row will be notated, as I hope the notations for the
bottom row are obvious enough.

Going left-to-right:

1. **Bk. Lb-Cf.**
   - Black Base
   - Light Blue Flower Charge

2. **Wh. Bk-Cc. Pi-Tb+Tt.**
   - White Base
   - Black Roundel
   - Pink Chevron
   - Pink Inverted Chevron

3. **Bl. Wh-Sx.**
   - Blue Base
   - White Saltire
  
4. **Bl. Wh-Cs.**
   - Black Base
   - White Skull Charge

5. **Bl. Lb-Cb. Ye-Wtl.**
   - Blue Base
   - Light Blue Field Masoned
   - Yellow Per Bend Sinister
  
6. **Gn+Li-Gx. Bk-Cr.**
   - *Green-Lime Gradient* â€“ *either:* Green Base, Lime Base Gradient; *or*: Lime Base, Green Gradient
   - Black Creeper Charge

7. **Wh. Rd-Sbar. Bk-Tmb+Tmt+Sch.**
   - White Base
   - Red Paly
   - Black Base Indented
   - Black Chief Indented
   - Black Fess
  
8. **Or. Ye-Btr+Bbl. Rd-Cc.**
   - Orange Base
   - Yellow Chief Sinister Canton
   - Yellow Base Dexter Canton
   - Red Roundel

[^2]: This is a crucial point, as there are some naming conflicts between
      Bedrock and Java Edition, mainly in the Per Bends.
