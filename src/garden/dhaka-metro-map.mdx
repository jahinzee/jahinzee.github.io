# Concept: Dhaka Metro Rail map

*See also: [Concept: Dhaka Metro Rail line maps](dhaka-metro-lines).*

In 2022, Dhaka opened its first rapid rail transit line, the
[MRT Line 6](https://dmtcl.gov.bd/site/page/1feee381-0cde-474d-a8f8-11c697814423/-)[^1]
running from Uttara North to Motijheel. I managed to give it a ride earlier this
year when I was visiting family, and I was very impressed - it was clean and
reliable, although the whole sticking-a-station-above-a-major-road thing was a
bit strange to me.

The data for this map was based on the current Phase 1 plans from the
[DMCTL website](https://dmtcl.gov.bd/)[^1]. As you might be able to tell, I also
took heavy aesthetic inspiration from the
[Sydney Trains/Metro map](https://transportnsw.info/sites/default/files/document/2023/11/Sydney-rail-network-map.pdf).
It was a natural choice of influence, since I am a Sydneysider.
