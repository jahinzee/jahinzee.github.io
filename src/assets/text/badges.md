[Web badges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_badge) are cool. Here's mine!:

<div class="flex justify-center pt-3">
  <a href="/badges/jahinzee.gif">
    <img alt="jahinzee's Web badge" class="badge" src="/badges/jahinzee.gif" />
  </a>
</div>

Feel free to use this to link to my website, but please don't `href` it
from this domain – save it to your own server/CMS and load it from there.
