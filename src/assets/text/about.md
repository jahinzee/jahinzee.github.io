# About Me

Hi!, I'm Jahin (IPA: /d͜ʒʌhɪn/), and I often go by my username `jahinzee`
on the Internet.

Here are some fun facts about me:

---

## `/gen`

- I live in a place with an approximately _outlandish_ amount of
  greenery – I fear all the chlorophyll have invaded this website -
  what with all the green accents everywhere.

- My favourite consumables include (but is not limited to): chai, latte, chai
  latte, chicken of all sorts, and [spadeleaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centella_asiatica).

- I adore overcast, rainy, and thundery weather.

---

## `/sw`

- My two most favourite languages are **Python** and **Go**, although I have more experience
  with the former. I also know TS and JS, and have some knowledge in C and Scala.

- I also like to participate in hackathons, CTFs, and other competitive coding
  and software-related shenanigans, even though sometimes it's not good for my caffeine levels.

- My philosophy on code structure is very vibe-oriented, as I think it should
  be. This is not to be confused with [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding),
  which I think is silly.

- Despite spending ~75% of my undergraduate studies learning Java, I am
  currently very _rust_-y with it.

- Free and open-source software is awesome, but I'd also love to see more
  [Local-First](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) software out there
  as well.

## `/gfx`

- I've been doing graphic design for a very long time, ever since
  I picked up Microsoft PowerPoint when I was in primary school. I've moved on
  from my humble beginnings, now I use a mix of [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/),
  [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/) and [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy)
  for my graphical endeavours.

- Big fan of humanist sans-serif fonts, namely
  [Frutiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger_(typeface)) and
  [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto%20Sans).

- The [Android Holo/Dark Skeuomorphism](https://antifandom.com/aesthetics/wiki/Dark_Aero#Dark_Skeumorphism)[^1] aesthetic
  was the best aesthetic to ever exist, and I _will_ fight you on this.

---

## `/misc`

- I travel quite a bit, and sometimes take [photos](/darkroom) of where I go.

- Linguistics is awesome. One of these days, I will finish a conlang.

[^3]: _toki Inli:_ I can speak Toki Pona. My Toki Pona ability isn't great, but I sometimes think in Toki Pona.
