# About Me

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD029 -->

Hi!, I'm Jahin (IPA: /d͜ʒʌhɪn/), and I often go by my username ­– `jahinzee` –
quite a lot on the Internet.

1. I live in a place with an approximately _outlandish_ amount of
   succulents and plants – I fear all the chlorophyll have invaded this website -
   what with all the green accents everywhere.

2. My favourite consumables include (but is not limited to): chai, latte, chai
   latte, chicken of all sorts, [spadeleaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centella_asiatica), pasta, sushi, and Vegemite.

3. My mother tongue is Python – it's the language I'm most proficient in.
   I'm also adept in Go, Typescript, Javascript and `sh`, with
   some knowledge in C and Scala.

4. You can find stuff that I made on [my GitHub](https://github.com/jahinzee).
   It's mainly small utilities in Python or `sh`, and also the source of the
   website you are on right now.

5. I like to participate in hackathons, CTFs, and other competitive coding
   and software-related shenanigans.

6. My philosophy on code structure is very vibe-oriented, as I think it should
   be.

7. Despite vowing early on in my coding life that I would never _ever_ touch web
   development, that is [exactly what I like doing most at the moment](https://github.com/jahinzee/jahinzee.github.io).
   My main experience is building static multi-page sites, as well as some
   full-stack stuff.

8. Despite spending ~75% of my undergraduate studies learning Java, I am
   currently very rusty with it. There is no pun here.

9. Free and open-source software is awesome, but I'd also love to see more
   [Local-First](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) software out there
   as well.

10. Despite my hatred of The Cloud, rainy, thundery and overcast weather are
    my absolute favourite vibes.

11. I've been doing graphic design for longer than I've been coding, ever since
    I picked up Microsoft PowerPoint at the age of 7. I've moved on from my
    humble beginnings, now I use a mix of [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/),
    [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com/) and [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy)
    for my graphical endeavours.

12. Big fan of humanist sans-serif fonts, namely
    [Frutiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger_(typeface)) and
    [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto%20Sans).

13. I travel quite a bit, and sometimes take [photos](/darkroom) of where I go.

14. Linguistics is awesome. One of these days, I will finish a conlang.

15. I use [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) and (in part)
    [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/), btw.
